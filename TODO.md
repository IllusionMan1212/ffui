## TODO: use os.Exec. its much better cuz we can actually kill processes.
## TODO: kill the ffmpeg process on ctrl+c. (if terminal window terminates it'll probably leave a zombie process)
## TODO: fancy progress bars for single file and directory encoding.
## TODO: print the name of the current file being encoded e.g `Encoding "Video Example Test 1"...`.
## TODO: customizable encoding settings, using tui elements to control and select them. (not gonna work on this in the near future)
## TODO: ask user if they want the old videos deleted. (probably not gonna work on this in the near future too)
